## Install & Run

First of all you need to install all the dependencies. You do this by typing `npm i` in the terminal.

After the install has completed you type `npm start` in the terminal to start the application.

A live server will automatically connect on port 3001 where you will be able to view the site.

If you dont know what to do, just open your browser (works best in chrome) and go to: http://localhost:3001/

Enjoy!
